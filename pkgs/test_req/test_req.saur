;  X isn't found becuase its scoped to test_req
;  and the caller of the lambda exists outside test_req
;  meaning that when the lambda is called it is operating 
;  under the environment of caller


;
;   Best way to handle this 
;   would be to tag the cell with information
;   regarding where it exists relative to the caller
;   so when lambdas are executed they operate within
;   their defined context
